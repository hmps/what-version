What version
===

A small and simple Node CLI tool to inspect the specified version in a package's package.json.

## Installation

Clone this repo and run `npm link` in the root folder.

This will create two CLI commands:

- `what-version`
- `wv`

They both do the same thing, `wv` is just a shorter alternative.

## Usage

`$ what-version`
